    <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        2 eggs
        <br>
        1 cup warm water
        <br>
        1 green onion, chopped into small pieces
        <br>
        1/4 tsp salt
        <br>
        1/4 tsp white pepper
        <br>
        1/2 tsp chicken bouillon powder
        <br>
        1 tsp sesame oil
        <br>
        1 tsp soy sauce
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a steamer rack in the middle of a pan, and pour water into the pan until it is about 2 to 3 inches high. Let the water come to a boil.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and add in salt and chicken bouillon powder. Mix together thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of the warm water into the egg mixture and mix until bubbles start to appear at the top. Then, pour the remaining 3/4 cups of warm water into the mixture, and continue to stir until bubbles form once again.</li>
        <li>Place a bowl in the pan and pour the egg mixture into the bowl. Remove the bubbles on the surface of the mixture with a spoon, and cover the pan with a lid.</li>
        <li>Leave on high heat until the water in the pan is boiling again. Once boiling, lower to medium heat and let the eggs cook for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and keep the lid on. Let the eggs sit in the residual heat for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid. Drizzle white pepper, sesame oil, soy sauce, and green onion pieces evenly across the top of the eggs. Enjoy!</li>
