    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A big bowl of soft and silky eggs that slide right off from the spoon. It's like silken tofu's cousin!</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp chicken bouillon powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a steamer rack in the middle of a pan, and pour water into the pan until it is about 2 to 3 inches high. Let the water come to a boil.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and add in salt and chicken bouillon powder. Mix together thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of the warm water into the egg mixture and mix until bubbles start to appear at the top. Then, pour the remaining 3/4 cups of warm water into the mixture, and continue to stir until bubbles form once again.</li>
        <li>Place a bowl in the pan and pour the egg mixture into the bowl. Remove the bubbles on the surface of the mixture with a spoon, and cover the pan with a lid.</li>
        <li>Leave on high heat until the water in the pan is boiling again. Once boiling, lower to medium heat and let the eggs cook for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and keep the lid on. Let the eggs sit in the residual heat for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid. Drizzle white pepper, sesame oil, soy sauce, and green onion pieces evenly across the top of the eggs. Enjoy!</li>
