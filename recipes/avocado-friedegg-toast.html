    <p id="subheading">When a crispy fried egg meets creamy avocados, let's toast to double the protein goodness served on a slice of delicious bread.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        1 large egg
        <br>
        1 ripe avocado, pitted and peeled
        <br>
        1 slice of bread
        <br>
        1/4 tsp black pepper
        <br>
        1 teaspoon lemon juice
        <br>
        1 pinch of salt
        <br>
        1 pinch of cayenne pepper powder
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast the bread on a pan or in the toaster, until both sides turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Smash the avocado flesh into several lumps in a small bowl and add in lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Preheat the pan under high heat. Once smoke comes out from the center of the pan, turn down to medium heat and crack the egg into the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook the egg for around 2 to 3 minutes, until the egg whites are opaque and the edges become firm.</li>
        <li>Flip the egg and cook the other side for 2 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread the mashed avocados onto toast and top with the freshly fried egg. Season with salt and cayenne pepper. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
